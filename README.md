# Remarkable Paper Sync
This is a program (or set of programs) intended to allow a user to send a paper/book/etc. to their reMarkable device with accompanying metadata that the reMarkable can display. It relies on a local Python program to package the metadata and send it to the tablet, and a program on the reMarkable which will handle final renaming and placement due to the flattened file storage method that the reMarkable software uses.

**Not in a good state to be considered "done" so nothing is pushed to main. All current work in the dev branch.**
